Basic networking protocol:

Servers never initiates exchanges and only responds to clients requests

Clients always initiate data exchange.

Data packets are structured as json objects with the keys:
	"action" the action to be executed
	"data" neccessary data for the command
	"error" Returns info when erro occured

Connection initiation:
	client connects
	server responds with ack, data = servername
	client either responds with ack or nack, data=clientname
	if error happend server reponds with "close" and error

Data transfer:
	server/client accepts any data until "ack" is send.
	All data will be joined and read as json
